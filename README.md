# British Railways Feedback Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of feedback from British Railways, aiming to identify key issues, propose solutions, and highlight positive aspects based on a comprehensive dataset of reviews and ratings. Leveraging artificial intelligence techniques for data cleaning, oversampling, and weight management, as well as advanced AI-driven summarization with sentence transformers, the project provides a nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by the railway system. The ability to connect these challenges to specific railway companies enables the proposal of targeted solutions tailored to each entity's unique circumstances.
